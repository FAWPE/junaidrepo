# StudentCourse Project README

## Frameworks and Language Used
- Framework: Spring Boot
- Language: Java
- Database: SQL

## Project Summary
The **StudentCourse** project is a Spring Boot application that manages student, course, book, address, and laptop entities. These entities are organized into four packages: **model**, **controller**, **service**, and **repo**. Each package plays a specific role in the application:

## Data Flow Structure

### Model Package
The **model** package contains the following entities:
- Student
- Course
- Book
- Address
- Laptop

These classes represent the core data entities of the application and serve as the foundation for storing and managing student and course-related information.

### Controller Package
The **controller** package houses the API endpoints for the application. Each entity has a corresponding controller class with API methods for various operations, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data. The naming convention for these classes is as follows: `{EntityName}Controller`. For example, the Student entity is managed by the StudentController.

### Service Package
The **service** package is responsible for handling the business logic of the application. It contains classes that encapsulate the operations and workflows related to the entities. The naming convention for these classes is `{EntityName}Service`. For instance, the StudentService class manages the business logic for the Student entity.

### Repo Package
The **repo** (repository) package defines interfaces that extend the JpaRepository provided by Spring Data JPA. These interfaces facilitate the interaction with the SQL database and enable basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the entities. The naming convention for these interfaces is `I{EntityName}Repo`. For example, the IStudentRepo interface is responsible for database operations related to the Student entity.

## Data Structure Used
The project utilizes the **Set** data structure in various parts of the application. Sets are used to store collections of unique elements, which can be particularly useful for managing relationships between entities, such as enrolling students in courses without duplicates.

This README provides an overview of the structure and components of the **StudentCourse** project. For detailed implementation and usage instructions, please refer to the documentation and source code within each package.
